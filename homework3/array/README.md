Program to calculating two poly for adding and deducting each other.


/*
  This structure is used to store a polynomial term. An array of such terms represents a
  polynomial.
  The "coeff" element stores the coefficient of a term in the polynomial,while
  the "exp"   element stores the exponent.

  Example)
  Expression 1 = 2.0 + 1.0x^1 + 2.0x^2 + 4.0x^3
  Expression 2 = 2.0 + 3.0x^1 + 1.0x^2 + 5.0x^3 + 4.0x^4 + 2.0x^5
  Expression after addition = 4.0 + 4.0x^1 + 3.0x^2 + 9.0x^3 + 4.0x^4 + 2.0x^5
  Expression after deduction = 0.0 + -2.0x^1 + 1.0x^2 + -1.0x^3 + 0.0x^0 + 0.0x^0
